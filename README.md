# ðŸš€ Rocket Simulation (Java)

A simple vertical rocket launch simulation written in Java.  
It calculates the maximum altitude of a rocket given the initial velocity and simulates the height at each second.

## Features
- Input initial velocity (m/s)
- Calculate maximum altitude using physics formula
- Simulate height at each second until the rocket falls
- Output results in the console

## Example
Initial velocity (m/s): 20
0ç§’: 0.00 m
1ç§’: 15.10 m
2ç§’: 20.41 m
3ç§’: 15.92 m
...

## Technologies
- Java (Scanner, loops, arrays)
- Basic physics (kinematics: vÂ² / 2g)

## What I Learned
- How to combine physics formulas with Java code
- Using arrays to store simulation data
- Console input/output and formatting with `printf`

## Future Improvements
- Use 0.1s steps for more precision
- Export results to CSV
- Visualize trajectory with JavaFX or graphs
